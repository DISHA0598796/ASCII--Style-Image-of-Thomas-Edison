Edison Face Printer
hey this is a simple python script called Edison.py that prints out thomas edisons face in ascii art right in your terminal. edison invented the light bulb ya know.
what it does
it uses just loops to print spaces and # signs line by line. no fancy stuff like functions or lists or saving the art in strings. all hardcoded with for loops.probs
fixed art cant change. needs mono font. no inputs or errors handled.
who made
just me messing around with loops. tweak if u want.

No Dependencies: Runs on standard Python (tested on Python 3.x) without importing any modules.
Terminal Output: Designed to display correctly in a standard terminal or command prompt window.
